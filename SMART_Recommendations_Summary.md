**Project Goal:** Reduce overall Data Clarification Form (DCF) Turnaround Time (TAT) by 30% and improve data quality.

Based on a comprehensive data analysis, the following SMART recommendations are proposed to address key identified issues:

---

**1. Targeted Training & Process Review for Reference Lab Alpha: High Rate of Sample Mislabelling Errors**

* **Specific:** Implement mandatory, targeted retraining for all sample handling staff at Reference Lab Alpha on SOP-005 (Correct Sample Labelling and Chain of Custody). Conduct a 1-month intensive review of Reference Lab Alpha's internal sample intake and labelling processes, comparing them against consortium SOPs.
* **Measurable:**
    * Reduce DCFs attributed to "Sample Mislabelling" from Reference Lab Alpha by 70% (from current average of X per week to Y per week).
    * Decrease the average TAT for resolving mislabelling DCFs originating from Lab Alpha by 50% (from Z days to W days).
* **Achievable:** Retraining can be conducted within two weeks, and the process review can be completed by a dedicated quality assurance officer. Lab Alpha management has agreed to cooperate.
* **Relevant:** Addresses a significant source of recurring, critical errors from a specific lab, directly impacting sample integrity and data reliability, and contributing to TAT delays.
* **Time-bound:**
    * Retraining to be completed by May 31, 2025.
    * Process review and gap analysis report by June 14, 2025.
    * Initial impact assessment on error rates and TAT by July 12, 2025.

**2. Enhancement of Data Entry Protocols for Study `ctCardio002`: Reduction of Transcription Errors**

* **Specific:** Revise and reinforce data entry protocols for Study `ctCardio002`, focusing on critical data fields identified as prone to transcription errors (e.g., patient IDs, visit dates). Implement a mandatory secondary verification step (double data entry or peer review) for these fields before data submission from participating sites.
* **Measurable:**
    * Decrease DCFs related to "Data Transcription Errors" in Study `ctCardio002` by 60% (from current average of A per site per month to B per site per month).
* **Achievable:** Protocol revision can be completed by the central data management team. Secondary verification can be integrated into existing site workflows with minimal disruption, potentially using existing staff.
* **Relevant:** Targets a specific high-volume error type within a major ongoing study, improving data accuracy and reducing the need for subsequent clarifications, thus saving time.
* **Time-bound:**
    * Revised protocols and training materials to be distributed by May 24, 2025.
    * Secondary verification to be implemented at all `ctCardio002` sites by June 7, 2025.
    * Monitor and report on transcription error rates monthly, with the first impact report due by July 15, 2025.

**3. Streamlining DCF Query Resolution Workflow: Expedited TAT for Common Queries**

* **Specific:** Develop and implement a "Fast-Track Resolution Pathway" for the top 3 most frequent, non-critical DCF query types (e.g., "Missing Non-Essential Visit Note," "Illegible Ancillary Data"). This pathway will involve pre-defined resolution steps and empower designated personnel at sites/labs to resolve these common queries directly within 48 hours, bypassing standard multi-level review where appropriate.
* **Measurable:**
    * Reduce the average TAT for the identified top 3 common query types by 75% (from current average of C days to D days or less).
    * Increase the percentage of these common queries resolved within 48 hours to 90%.
* **Achievable:** Identifying common queries is straightforward from the data. Pre-defined steps can be documented, and existing experienced staff can be designated and trained.
* **Relevant:** Addresses a significant volume of DCFs that, while perhaps minor, contribute to overall TAT burden. Frees up resources from complex queries.
* **Time-bound:**
    * Top 3 query types and fast-track protocols to be defined by May 31, 2025.
    * Designated personnel trained and pathway implemented by June 21, 2025.
    * Monitor TAT for fast-tracked queries weekly, with a performance review by July 19, 2025.

**Next Steps:**
We recommend a meeting with relevant department heads to discuss the feasibility and detailed implementation plan for these recommendations. We will provide progress updates bi-weekly to the Project Steering Committee.
